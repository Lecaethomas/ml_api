# Machine Learning API
## How?
### Install the requirements.txt
### then what's going on?
The API takes text as input and then applies few preprocessing : 
- removal of stop-words/punctuation/non-alphabetic characters
- lemmatisation 
- vectorisation using tf-idf
and then infers the note using the preprocessed text and the model built using SVM algorithm.
This note is then returned by the API
### the interface 😂
You can use the very simple interface made in few minutes using streamlit
