# Machine Learning API
## How?
go to your local directory containing this repo's code and : 
- Install the requirements.txt: 
``` conda install requirements.txt 	```
- Start the API : 
``` python app.py 	```
### Then what's going on?
The API takes text as input and then applies few preprocessing : 
- removal of stop-words/punctuation/non-alphabetic characters
- lemmatisation 
- vectorisation using tf-idf algorithm (from pre-trained model)
and then infers the note using the preprocessed text and the model built using SVM algorithm.
This note is then returned by the API
### The interface ðŸ˜‚
To test the API you can use the very simple interface made in few minutes using streamlit
To do so type: 	
``` streamlit run front.py	```
